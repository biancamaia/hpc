This programs purposes lays on the objective of solving a two-dimensional time dependent Schrödinger equation for a given potential. Here is built an elliptical potential, so the problem is characterized by the potential well problem and it's not necessary changing any initial conditions. 

There will be makefiles for both versions, the serial one and the parallelized one.

Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-2600 CPU @ 3.40GHz

If your processor is similar to this one, I strongly recommend compiling the parallel program with eight threads for optimizing its execution time.
